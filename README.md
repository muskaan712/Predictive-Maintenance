#Temperature Prediction using ARIMA

ARIMA model aims at using all the history of past fault events
and then analyze it for forecasting or predicting the future
failure. It is in the form of predictive features.

```
Aim: This notebook is aimed at developing a predictive model using ARIMA that detects future temperature for predictive maintenance.
ARIMA model is used for the trend analysis which integrates differencing, moving averages, lagged values of the observations.
Major parts of ARIMA Model are-    
    - To eliminate all residual correlations, generalize the walk models. 
    - Exponential smoothing is generalized thus incorporates trends and seasonality.
    - Stationarize the regression models.

ARIMA model is denoted as the ARIMA (p,d,q), where p is the number of autoregressive terms, d is the number of differences need to be made for stationarity, and q is the number of lagged errors in the prediction.
